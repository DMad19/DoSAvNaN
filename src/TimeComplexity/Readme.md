#### Timecomplexity:
It's a function that tells us about the relationship of how the time grows as the input grows.

We consider complexity only for large data.

Things to consider:
1. Always look for worst case complexity
2. Always look at complexity for large/infinite data
3. We don't care about actual time. We only see relationship. Hence, we ignore constants.
4. Always ignore less dominating terms.
