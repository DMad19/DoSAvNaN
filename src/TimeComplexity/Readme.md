### Timecomplexity:
It's a function that tells us about the relationship of how the time grows as the input grows.

We consider complexity only for large data.

Things to consider:
1. Always look for worst case complexity
2. Always look at complexity for large/infinite data
3. We don't care about actual time. We only see relationship. Hence, we ignore constants.
4. Always ignore less dominating terms.

##### Big O Notation : upper bound of time complexity (worst case)
##### Big Omega Notation : lower bound of time complexity (best case)
##### Theta Notation : both upperbound and lower bound time complexity
##### Little O Notation : Loose upper bound but stronger statement (f<O(g))
##### Little Omega Notation : Loose lower bound but stronger statement ( f>O(g))

### Space Complexity:

Space complexity is equal to input space + auxilary space
